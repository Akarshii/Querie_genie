An intelligent conversational assistant designed to answer questions and engage users with real-time, context-aware responses about a company's  website. It combines web scraping, OCR-powered image text extraction, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure it can respond to queries even when key information is embedded inside images rather than plain text.
Key features:

Dynamic Knowledge Extraction – Automatically scrapes the site for the latest data.

Image-to-Text Understanding – Uses OCR to read names, titles, and other text from images.

RAG Pipeline Integration – Retrieves the most relevant content before answering.

Context Preservation – Keeps conversation flow natural without losing prior context.

Accurate Profile Details – Correctly maps bios, roles, and links from scraped content.

Whether a user asks for founder details, team bios, services, or other company info, the chatbot delivers fast, accurate, and complete answers in a human-like manner.
